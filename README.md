Ted's Java Refactoring - Online Banking sample application

This Git repo is meant to supplement the Online Banking Code Refactoring tutorial series at Ted's Java Refactoring channel on Youtube.

You can find the first video in the series at this URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cblMVInbHrg

This project tracks the online banking application from its initial version to a cleaner and modular version. 

The initial version of the project is taken with thanks from JavaTPoint: https://www.javatpoint.com/src/projects/projecteclipse/onlinebanking.zip
